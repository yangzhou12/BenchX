## Fine-Tuning MedVLP Models on Downstream Tasks

To test the MedVLP model on a certain downstream task, list the path to its model config under `includes:` in the downstream task config YML file.

MedVLP config files are stored at  [`configs/<task_name>/<dataset_name>/<model_name>/`](configs/finetune/models/).
